This is my personal site. My public persona. All my non-personal socials are linked here. 

## Setup

My main device is a [Framework 13](https://frame.work/products/laptop13-diy-intel-ultra-1/configuration/new) (Framework 16 otw! ðŸ˜Ž). It has the following specs:
- AMD Ryzen 7 7840u 
- 2.8k 120Hz Matte Display
- 96 GB of DDR5 RAM
- 2 TB of Storage

I run Linux. I like an OS where I can customize it to my needs. As for my distro, I chose [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/). My system configuration files are [here](https://github.com/javacafe01/nix-config).
