I'm a student living in San Diego, CA. I'm doing my Master's in EE with a focus in VLSI Systems.

My undergraduate degree was also in Electrical Engineering. After I received my Bachelor's, I went to work as an Engineer for a utility company on electric grid operations. After a few months, I left to work for an aerospace and defense company as an Embedded Software Engineer.

After half a year, I wasn't learning anything new at this company. The work was repetative and it didn't allow me to have free time for personal projects. I always had an interest for VLSI and microelectronics, so I decided to leave and pursue my higher education after a year and a half. My current interest is IC layout design.
