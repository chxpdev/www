I'm an electrical engineering graduate student living in San Diego, CA. I'm doing my Master's in EE with a focus in VLSI.

My undergraduate degree was also in electrical engineering. After I received my Bachelor's, I went to work as an Engineer for the utility company on electric grid operations. That came to an end after a few months. I then worked for an aerospace and defense company as a firmware engineer for a little over a year.

The work environment at the aero company was definitely something. It was fast, tense, and demanding. I worked 50-60 hours every week developing new features and new firmware from scratch for different flight-critical systems. However, I wasn't learning anything new. I always had an interest for VLSI and microelectronics, so I decided to leave and pursue my higher education.

I like to keep my life private, but if you'd like to connect with me on LinkedIn, feel free to contact me on Discord or Matrix.
