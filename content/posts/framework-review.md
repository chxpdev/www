A couple of months ago I bought a Framework 13, and I recently received a Framework 16. This post is about the ups and (mostly) downs. *Spoiler: I sold the Framework 16*.

## The Framework philosophy

Laptops used to be upgradeable. They were portable machines that we could take apart and easily repair or upgrade whenever we wanted to. As per corporate greed, as things got smaller and thinner, it was more profitable for companies to ship laptops that weren't engineered to be repaired or upgraded (ex. soldered RAM). Framework looks to change that with upgradeable and premium laptops.

## Framework 13

I bought the DIY edition (AMD 7840u) for $1,348.19. I bought the RAM (Crucial 2x48GB DDR5) for $224.99 and the SSD (WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X) for $149.99. This came with a 2k 60Hz display by default. I totally disregarded the fact that with this resolution I would have to rely on fractional scaling for Linux... which I would rather not. The Linux desktop has poor fractional scaling support (except you KDE ❤️). Framework offers a 2.8k 120Hz display (the only good decision they have done imo), which I then bought for $307.54. This allowed me to skip fractional scaling. **The total for this laptop was a hefty $2030.71.**

The Framework 13 is sleek and has a very premium look. Don't get me wrong, it's not as premium and robust as a Macbook. Nothing beats Apple quality. But it's great for such an upgradeable device. The 2.8k screen is crisp, especially since I can do proper scaling to 200% (I still cannot believe that Linux cannot get fractional scaling done properly but Windows can). The only "downside" to the screen is that the two top corners are rounded, probably because Framework took this screen from a different laptop lineup. But I think it looks nice:

This laptop also has a 3:2 aspect ratio! This gives more height to the screen, which definitely helps with productivity.

Let's talk up opening up this laptop...
